# getjumpscared

A single Powershell script which will trigger a jumpscare from Five Nights at Freddy's which was written in Python    

I'm not sure if this works on Linux or Mac, because I obviously designed it for Windows.  

## Dependencies

- Python  

- The following libraries, which will be automatically installed:  

```bat
pip install opencv-python
pip install pygame
pip install pycaw
pip install comtypes
```

## How to use it

Just run the Powershell script.  

Please note that you'll need non-restricted internet access for it to work.  

## How to make it seem more legit

Feel free to change the folder where it will be installed to something else.
