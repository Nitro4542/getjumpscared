# getjumpscared

A single powershell script which will trigger a jumpscare, which was written in Python.  

I'm not sure if this works on Linux or Mac, because I obviously designed it for Windows.  

## Dependencies

- Python  

- The following libraries, which will be automatically installed:  

```bat
pip install opencv-python
pip install pygame
pip install pycaw
pip install comtypes
```

## How to use it

Just run the Powershell script.  

Please note that you'll need non-restricted internet access for it to work.
